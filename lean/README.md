# HornerLean

### **Project Structure**

| File | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `Basic.lean/` | Small sanity checks |
| `CompPolyAssumptions.lean` | Temporary axioms/assumptions used to unblock the PoC |
| `Extracted/Horner_eval_rs.lean` | The Lean code generated by cargo hax into lean from the Rust Horner implementation. |
| `Proof.lean` | Minimal “PoC proofs on extracted code”: small shape/behavior lemmas about the extracted horner_eval_i64 in RustM (not full mathematical correctness yet). |
| `Spec.lean` | The CompPoly-based mathematical specification layer: |
| `SpecProof.lean` | The “spec-only correctness” theorem: |
| `README.md` | This documentation |
